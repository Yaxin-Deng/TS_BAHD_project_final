## Relationship between BAHD acyltransferases and the putative Datura stramonium tigloyltransferase

BAHD acyltransferases constitute a large and functionally diverse enzyme family that catalyzes CoA-dependent acylation reactions in specialized metabolism across the Solanaceae. Several well-characterized BAHDs—including acylsugar acyltransferases (ASATs), alkaloid acyltransferases, and phenolic ester-forming enzymes—share the canonical HXXXD catalytic motif and a similar fold, despite acting on different substrates. Because tropane alkaloids also require acylation steps during their modification, BAHD enzymes have been repeatedly proposed as candidates for catalyzing late steps in tropane alkaloid biosynthesis, including the tigloylation of tropane scaffolds.

To evaluate whether a BAHD enzyme in D. stramonium could function as a tigloyltransferase (TS), I compared a curated set of clade 3 BAHD reference proteins with the Datura proteome.
**The BLAST analysis shows that the top hits in Datura exhibit high sequence identity (70–100%) with known clade 3 BAHD acyltransferases,** and importantly, the Datura TS candidate (annotated as **DsTS ANN02033-RA)** is among the strongest matches (see BLAST barplot). This indicates that the putative Datura TS belongs to a BAHD subclade tightly associated with acylsugar and alkaloid acyltransferases, consistent with a possible acylation role.

The phylogenetic analysis further supports this placement:

**the neighbor-joining tree clusters the Datura TS candidate directly within clade 3 BAHDs and close to Atropa belladonna BAHD sequences,** a group known to contain enzymes involved in specialized alkaloid and acylsugar metabolism. While phylogeny alone cannot infer function, the tree strongly suggests evolutionary relatedness and positions the Datura TS candidate within the correct subfamily of BAHD enzymes expected to catalyze CoA-dependent acylations.

To assess whether the Atropa and Datura TS-like CDS differ at the sequence level, I compared four A. belladonna TS isoforms with the D. stramonium TS candidate.
**The SNP analysis revealed numerous sequence variants among these homologous CDS, indicating substantial divergence between Atropa TS isoforms and the Datura candidate.** This divergence may reflect species-specific specialization of acylation steps in tropane alkaloid biosynthesis, consistent with the distinct tropane alkaloid profiles observed across Solanaceae species. Importantly, the presence of many non-missing SNP calls across all sequences suggests that the Datura candidate is not a simple ortholog of a single Atropa TS isoform, but rather a structurally related BAHD enzyme that may have adapted to Datura-specific metabolic contexts.

Taken together, these analyses demonstrate that:

1. The Datura TS candidate is a bona fide member of the clade 3 BAHD acyltransferase family.

2. Its closest homologs in Datura are annotated BAHD enzymes with known or putative roles in acylation reactions.

3. Phylogeny and sequence variation suggest functional relatedness to, but divergence from, Atropa TS isoforms.

4. Given that tropane alkaloid modification requires an acylation step, and that known TS enzymes in Atropa are BAHD acyltransferases, the Datura candidate is highly plausible as a TS enzyme involved in tropane alkaloid biosynthesis.

Although biochemical characterization is still required to confirm its substrate specificity, the combined BLAST, phylogenetic, and SNP-level evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that the D. stramonium TS candidate represents a BAHD acyltransferase that participates in a late-stage acylation reaction in the tropane alkaloid pathway, analogous to the tigloyltransferases described in A. belladonna.

## In summary, the D. stramonium TS candidate is evolutionarily and structurally embedded within clade 3 BAHD acyltransferases, shows strong homology to known acylating enzymes, and exhibits sequence divergence consistent with species-specific tropane alkaloid metabolism, making it a strong candidate for the tigloyltransferase responsible for late-stage modification of tropane alkaloids in Datura.
